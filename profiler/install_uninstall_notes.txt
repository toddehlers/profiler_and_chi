The registerProfilerDLL.bat file contains these files on my computer:

"C:\Program Files\Common Files\ArcGIS\bin\ESRIRegAsm.exe" /p:desktop C:\local\FromGMail\DanielProfiler.NET\obj\Debug\Profiler1.dll

You should change the location of the DLL to the place you put it, and that depends on the architecture of the machine you are using.  On a 32 bit machine it looks like this:

"C:\Program Files\ArcGIS\Desktop10.0\Bin\Profiler1.dll" 

Quotes are necessary with paths that include spaces, as above.  On 64 bit machines, it should look like this:

"C:\Program Files (x86)\ArcGIS\Desktop10.0\Bin\Profiler1.dll"
